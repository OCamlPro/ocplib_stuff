{1 Library ocplib_stuff}

This library contains some basic stuff that is used in some OCP libraries 
and applications. Most of them are probably available in other extensions
of the standard libraries (extlib, core, etc.), but we are used to these
ones.



The entry point of this library is the module: {!Ocplib_stuff}.
